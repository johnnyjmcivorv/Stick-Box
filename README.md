# Stick-Box
A tool for creating digital scultpures, inspired by the art of Ha55ii and Dan-Ball.

I am an artist and do not know how to program, however I am good at design. You can

The end goal of this project is to create interactive wallpapers. I figured that
there should be some sort of simple GUI for creating these. You basically have an
editor, where you can build little joint sculptures that move and can be dragged
around, and then you save it as some sort of wallpaper. There wouldn't really be
any fancy particle elements like fire explosives etc like in Powder Game / Falling
Sand, it would be more focused on joints.

When this wallpaper is set, the scene you have created will sit there and do its
thng until you decide to mess around with it. You can also create various moving
stick figures.

I don't want this manipulation to be destructive, however. It's more like you can
rearrange or knock over things. Say I make a kitchen scene with a little table,
an apple on top of it, a dresser -- there's a little hopping frog in there -- I
want you to be able to shake and move those things around, but they can always be
rearranged back into place, or in a new order.

Your help would be much appreciated. Thank you
